# KardashevOS_Level1
This project is a ready-to-run full-stack template for AI/web apps. It ships a fast Gateway API that routes requests to modular services (e.g., text generation, alerts, dashboards). Start instantly with included stubs, then plug in your real services. Runs via Docker Compose with simple Windows scripts for start/stop/clean.
