# KardashevOS Level 1

This repository is the starting point for a future full-stack template. At the moment it only contains placeholder batch scripts and basic documentation. The Gateway API and modular services mentioned in earlier drafts have not yet been implemented.

## Windows helper scripts

The following batch files are provided as simple placeholders:

- `start.bat` – prints a message indicating the system is starting.
- `stop.bat` – prints a message indicating the system is stopping.
- `clean.bat` – prints a message indicating the environment is being cleaned.

These scripts do not start any real services yet but can be expanded as the project evolves.
